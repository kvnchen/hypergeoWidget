## Glossary

**Population**

What we're sampling from. Usually this is the deck. For questions regarding the opening hand or the opening hand plus a few turns, we use the deck's maximum size as the population.

**Sample size**

The number of cards we see in any given situation. For opening hand + n turns questions, use 7 + n draw steps on the play, and 8 + n on the draw.

**Successes in Population**

The number of hits in our deck.

**Successes in Sample**

The number of hits we need to satisfy the requirements of our question.
